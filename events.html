                        asked listeners to annotate and rate the synthesized voices from the IBM Watson Catalogue in order to map
                        the listening experiences of existing synthesized voices. This research project was made in collaboration
                        with researchers from Complex & Intelligent Systems, Passau University.

                        [multi’vocal] was be presented in the session Suspensions – Mobilizing Art and Aesthetics in Cultural
                        Research at the ACSIS conference in June 2017
                        This session grappled with the ways that art can be related to research practice within the diverse fields
                        of cultural studies. It examined the role of subjectivity as well as various methodological entanglements of
                        theory and empirical material. What happens when artistic practices are combined with the research practices
                        of Cultural Sciences/Cultural Studies institutions? What happens when the practices of disciplines like
                        visual culture, ethnology and cultural analysis are enmeshed with artistic practice? The session came from a
                        workshop including cultural researchers and practicing artists held at The Department of Arts and Cultural
                        Sciences at Lund University in October 2016.
