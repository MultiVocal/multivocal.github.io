            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <p>What are the politics and aesthetics of synthesized voices? What notions of identity, personhood and will do we
                ascribe to the synthesized voices communicating with us?</p>
            
            <p>Living in a world where machines are talking to us with voices, personalities and emotional expressions, we believe
                it is important to discuss questions of representation, character design and aesthetics. Most of the synthesized
                voices we hear from our mobile phones, smart assistants, and in transportation systems have one vocal identity. This
                could be different.</p>
            
            <p>[multi’vocal] is an ever-evolving non-binary synthesized voice created by a (digital) community of participants with
                different age, gender, and geographical origin. We seek to create an open source and participatory alternative to
                the proprietary voices with singular identities. We present iterations of the voice on events and talks but the
                voice is currently not available online.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>The [multi’vocal] collective is an art and research based community exploring synthesized voices with a feminist
                activist approach.</p>
